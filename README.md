# Pather
Solution to pather problem written in Java

Given that the text file 'input.txt' contains a rectangular block of dot
characters ('.') and two or more hash characters ('#'), write a program 'pather'
which writes out to 'output.txt' the same data with the two '#' characters
joined by asterisks ('*'). The command will be invoked like this:

  pather input.txt output.txt

Your job is to implement 'pather' in this directory. This script will run it
for you and test the accuracy of the output. The file 'pather' will need to
be executable (chmod +x pather). It maybe written in any language.

The rules for the path:

* No diagonals.
* Only change direction once.
* Start with a vertical line and then complete with a horizontal line.

Please feel free to write further tests if you believe the program can be
improved upon. Have fun with it.
